== Acknowledgements / Fork Origin ==

SATORI Studio is a fork of Beaver Builder Lite by The Beaver Builder Team, used and modified under the terms of the GPL v2+ license.

== Translation / Text Domains ==

SATORI Studio retains legacy translation domains (such as `fl-builder` and `bb-plugin`) to remain compatible with upstream Beaver Builder Lite language packs and third-party integrations. New SATORI-authored strings should use the `satori-studio` text domain. Existing domains should not be renamed until a formal migration plan is documented.
