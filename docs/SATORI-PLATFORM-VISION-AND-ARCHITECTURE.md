# SATORI Platform Vision and Architecture

## Purpose

This document defines the operating model for SATORI Studio as a stable open-core builder platform with a clearly separated commercial extension layer.

## Hybrid Open-Core Commercial Model

SATORI Studio operates under an open-core model:

- Core builder engine remains GPL (Beaver Builder Lite origin)
- Platform curation and refinements remain open
- Advanced capabilities delivered via commercial Pro layer

### Commercial Boundary Clarification

SATORI does not monetise Beaver Builder Lite itself.

Monetisation occurs in:
- Extended functionality
- Workflow modules
- Enterprise tooling
- SaaS integration
- Licensing infrastructure

## Architectural Layers

1. **Open Core Layer** — WordPress + Beaver Builder Lite forked as SATORI Studio – Lite.
2. **Curated Platform Layer** — hardening, governance, branding alignment, and admin UX consistency.
3. **SSP Pro Layer** — licensed add-ons, integrations, and enterprise workflow acceleration.

## Delivery Principle

The architecture preserves GPL obligations and attribution in the Lite layer while enabling sustainable product delivery through optional Pro capabilities.
