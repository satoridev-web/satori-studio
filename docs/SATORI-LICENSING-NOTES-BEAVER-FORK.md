# SATORI Studio Licensing Notes — Beaver Builder Fork (Text-Only Pass)

## Origin and Lineage
- **Upstream Project:** Beaver Builder Lite by The Beaver Builder Team (FastLine Media LLC).
- **Fork Status:** SATORI Studio is a fork that reuses and modifies portions of Beaver Builder Lite under the terms of the GPL v2 or later license.
- **License Reference:** See `license.txt` for the full GPL v2+ text.

## Attribution and Obligations
- The original Beaver Builder Lite copyright and notices must be preserved.
- All modifications and new code shipped with SATORI Studio continue to be licensed under GPL v2 or later (or another GPL v2+ compatible license where applicable).
- Upstream authors must be credited wherever reasonable in documentation and notices.
- SATORI Studio distributions must make source code available in accordance with GPL requirements.

## SATORI Copyright Notice
- **Copyright © 2024 Satori Graphics Pty Ltd**
- New contributions made as part of the SATORI Studio fork are provided under GPL v2 or later while retaining upstream attribution.

## Text Domain Notes
- Legacy Beaver Builder text domains remain in portions of the codebase to preserve translation compatibility.
- New or clearly SATORI-authored strings should prefer the `satori-studio` text domain.
- Future phases will evaluate consolidating text domains once downstream compatibility is assured.

## Known Inherited Assets & TODOs
- Current iconography and some visual assets still reflect Beaver Builder branding.
- A later phase will replace these assets with SATORI-native artwork and update any related CSS/image paths.
- No binary assets were modified in this text-only pass.
