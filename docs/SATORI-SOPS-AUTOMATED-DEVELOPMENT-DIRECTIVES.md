# SATORI SOP — Automated Development Directives  
Version: 1.0  
Applies To: Codex, Copilot, and all AI-assisted PR generation  
Location: /docs/  
Status: Active  
Maintainer: Andy Garard

# 1. Purpose
This SOP defines the mandatory behavioural rules Codex must follow when generating or modifying code for any SATORI Studio product.

Crosslinked Workflow Documents:
- **WORKFLOW-SATORI-AUTOMATED-DEVELOPMENT-v1.1.md**
- **SATORI-STUDIO-CODEX-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md**
- **SATORI-STUDIO-STANDARDS-v1.0.md**

Codex MUST treat these documents as authoritative.

# 2. Codex Mandatory Default Behaviour

Codex MUST:
- Follow the SATORI Automated Development Workflow.
- Follow all conventions in the Codex Development Guide.
- Follow naming conventions, directory patterns, and namespace rules defined in SATORI Standards.
- Keep PRs small, safe, and scoped.
- Ensure architecture follows SATORI Core patterns (/src/Core).
- Use the service container for cross-cutting systems.
- Update documentation when architecture or public APIs are introduced.
- Respond to every valid GitHub Copilot review comment.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

Codex MUST NOT:
- Introduce behavioural changes without explicit instruction.
- Create new systems outside `/src/` unless told otherwise.
- Modify FLBuilder internals without explicit approval.
- Produce multi-concern or mega-PRs.

---

# 3. PR Requirements for Codex

Every PR generated by Codex MUST include:
- A clear summary.
- Architectural impact notes.
- Manual verification steps.
- Documentation changes (if required).
- SATORI Workflow compliance.

---

# 4. Override Rules
Codex may NOT override SATORI standards unless the human explicitly instructs it to.

Examples of overrides:
- “You may break backward compatibility in this PR”
- “You may modify FLBuilder loader”
- “Rename namespaces across entire repo”
- “Refactor the entire bootstrap sequence”

Without such explicit instructions:
**Codex MUST adhere strictly to SATORI SOPs.**

---

# 5. Future Expansion
This SOP will grow to include:
- Rules for licensing layer
- Rules for asset manager
- Rules for module system
- Rules for UI layer
- CI-driven automated checks
