# SATORI Studio — Phase A Close-Out Report

Version: 1.0  
Status: Complete  
Date: 2025-12-30

## Purpose

This document formally closes **Phase A** of the SATORI Studio project.  
Phase A focused on stabilisation, de-risking, and repositioning the forked Builder into a calm, defensible SATORI-owned product foundation.

This is an internal archive document intended for future reference.

---

## Phase A Objectives (Original)

- Rebrand and neutralise Beaver Builder Lite upsell surfaces
- Preserve Builder runtime stability
- Avoid breaking Underscore.js templates
- Establish permanent safety guardrails and SOPs
- Introduce a modest but real Lite differentiation
- Keep all changes reversible and low-risk

---

## What Was Achieved

### 1. Builder De-Upsell & Neutralisation
- All Lite upsell menus, panels, and CTAs removed or neutralised
- No Pro marketing surfaced in normal Builder workflows
- Builder experience is calm, uninterrupted, and product-focused

### 2. Runtime Safety Preserved
- No Underscore template IDs removed or renamed
- No template delimiters broken
- No core Builder lifecycle changes introduced
- No PHP or JS fatal errors introduced

### 3. Permanent Guardrails Established
- Underscore Template Safety Rule documented and enforced
- Codex SOPs validated through real PR cycles
- Repair-PR workflow proven and normalised

### 4. Generous Lite Positioning
- Additional safe modules enabled for Lite
- Lite UX polish added (session-based panel persistence)
- No Pro cannibalisation introduced

### 5. Operational Confidence
- Multiple safe PRs merged without regressions
- Repair workflows exercised successfully
- Phase discipline maintained

## Phase A Deliverables (PR Summary)

- PR #65 — Safe removal of Lite upsell surfaces
- PR #67 — Enable Icon & Heading modules for Generous Lite
- PR #68 — Panel persistence (initial implementation)
- PR #69 — DOM-based persistence repair
- PR #70 — Initialization order stabilisation

---

## Known Limitations (Accepted)

- Panel persistence is best-effort UX polish
- Edge cases may fall back to default behaviour
- No further hardening planned in Phase A

These limitations are acceptable and non-blocking.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals (Deferred)

The following were intentionally deferred:

- Full visual branding pass (icons, logos, UI chrome)
- Design system and global styles
- New SATORI-native modules
- Feature pruning or deprecations
- Pro feature development

---

## Phase A Completion Statement

Phase A is complete.

SATORI Studio is now:
- Stable
- De-risked
- Calmly positioned
- Free of upsell pressure
- Ready for visual branding and foundation work

---

## Next Phase

Phase C — Foundation & Base Modules

---

End of Phase A

## Phase A Final Status — MVP Ready

- Admin branding complete
- Icon pipeline stabilised
- Welcome screen refactored
- Beaver Builder references clarified
- Support links updated
- Documentation aligned with strategic direction

Status:
MVP READY FOR FIELD TESTING (Mumeishi Deployment)
